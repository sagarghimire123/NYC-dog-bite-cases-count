# NYC-dog-bite-cases-count
This project is about data analysis and data visualization of the NYC dog bite cases from 2015 to 2021. 
In this project we will present our analysis or result using various visualization methods. We will visualize various continious and catogerical
data during the data exploration.
Below are the topics or questions we will try to explore and answer during the project using
various visualization tools.

i. The trend of dogs biting throughout the given time frame from 2015 to 2021 using a
time-series plot.

ii. Analyzing the relation between weather and the number of bites using the heat map
for each month for the given time frame.

iii. Evaluating the number of bites for each year and comparing the total count for years
2020 and 2021 especially with previous years to see any decrease in bites because of
covid-19. For this evaluation, we are using a bar chart.

iv. Analyzing the number of bites for each borough of NYC by gender. For this
exploration, we are using a grouped bar chart.

v. Analyzing the number of bites for each borough using the total counts of bites by
plotting bar chart and pie chart.

vi. Plot the Stacked Area Chart for bites by gender for all the given years.

vii. Plot a radial pie chart for the top five breeds with the highest bite counts.
